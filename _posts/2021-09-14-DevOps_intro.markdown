In business, great things are never done by one person. It is a team effort. What could be a better example of teamwork than practicing DevOps?
DevOps is a culture in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to develop a software product. It is a combination of two words, ‘Dev’ and ‘Ops’. Dev means Development, and Ops means Operations. 
DevOps is a mindset where the development team collaborates with the operations team to accomplish the business goals.

The theory of DevOps has evolved from Agile methodology. The theory was originated by Patrick Debois, a system administrator while working for the Belgian government. 
As an agile practitioner, he believed that collaboration should also be between the development and operations teams. He discussed the idea further with Andrew Schafer at an Agile conference in Toronto in 2008. 
They referred to the principle as “agile systems administration”.
